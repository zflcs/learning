In trying to understand the culture of American, we must observe their lifestyle and the factor influencing their life.

First, the immense size of the United States results in the different lifestyle. Then, the other significant factor influencing American life, ethnic diversity, is probably even more important. 

The new immigrants from different country brought different languages and different cultures to the United States. Finally most of them assimilated to the dominant American culture.

In spite of some very important differences, however, there is still a tie that binds Americans together.

The American beliefs hold them together and makes them feel American. However, not all Americans hold these beliefs, nor do all Americans believe these things to the same degree. The way in which some Americans practice their beliefs may also differ, resulting in a great variety of lifestyle.
